##Description
This is my second week review project for Epicodus using HTML/CSS, git & javascript. It covers the second week of learning at Epicodus.
Our task was to create a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) that asks students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant
