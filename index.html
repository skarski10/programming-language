        <p>
          CSS and Design are if you want to focus on front-end development. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes at Epicodus.

        <h3>What is CSS and Web Design?</h3>

        <p>
          CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual and aural layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.
          <br>
          <br>
          Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces.

        <p>
          C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.
        </p>

        <h3>What is C#?</h3>

        <p>
          The C# (or C-sharp) programming language is one that enables developers to build applications that run on the .NET framework. Students who are well-versed in C# programming can use it to create client applications, database applications, distributed components, and much more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Students who learn C# programming and combine it with their knowledge of the .NET framework can target larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients for employment

          Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.

        <h3>What is Java?</h3>

        <p>
          Java is a programming language used to create dynamic web applications, applets within larger Web pages, and mobile Android applications. Students who learn java programming will be able to create dynamic web applications on their computer.

          PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.
        </p>

        <h3>What is PHP?</h3>

        <p>
          PHP is a popular programming language used for web development within the confines of HTML. The PHP language can create dynamic web page content or images used on websites or elsewhere. Students who learn to code in PHP will be able to collect form data, generate dynamic page content, send and receive cookies, and much more.

          Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>
        <p>
          Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. The Ruby programming language is best known as a language for building web applications in its corresponding Ruby on Rails framework. Taking the Ruby course is particularly beneficial due to the general-purpose nature of Ruby makes it suitable for a wide array of programming tasks; much like Pearl, Python, and other languages.
