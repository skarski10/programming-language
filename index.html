        <h2>CSS & Design</h2>
        <p>CSS and Design are if you want to focus on front-end development. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes at Epicodus.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hide-me" id="cUnhide">
        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p>
          C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The C# (or C-sharp) programming language is one that enables developers to build applications that run on the .NET framework. Students who are well-versed in C# programming can use it to create client applications, database applications, distributed components, and much more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Students who learn C# programming and combine it with their knowledge of the .NET framework can target larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients for employment

      <div class="hide-me" id="javaUnhide">
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
          Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java is a programming language used to create dynamic web applications, applets within larger Web pages, and mobile Android applications. Students who learn java programming will be able to create dynamic web applications on their computer. Most Java students also continue into our Android course, where they learn how to create mobile apps for Android devices.

        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <p>
          Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. The Ruby programming language is best known as a language for building web applications in its corresponding Ruby on Rails framework. Taking the Ruby course is particularly beneficial due to the general-purpose nature of Ruby makes it suitable for a wide array of programming tasks; much like Pearl, Python, and other languages.
